# {The Triangle Detector }
## {Project  Description }
{This is an application that detects a type of triangle using digits.
 It checks whether the dijits match the properties of a triangle whether it
 is Equlateral, Isosles or Scalene.The link to the project is here;https://github.com/joshuaagega/triangle-detector.}
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* To get to my project
* click on the link above
* click clone/download button
* download the zip
* enter the digits to detect your triangle
{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}
